# Task3-Linear_Regression
Objective: Implement and understand simple & multiple linear regression. 
Tools:  Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib
The steps included:
1.Loading and preprocessing the Housing dataset.
2.Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
3.Fitting a Linear Regression model to predict house prices.
4.Evaluating model performance using MAE, MSE, and RÂ² score.
5.Visualizing the regression line (for simple regression) and interpreting the learned coefficients. Both Simple Linear Regression (with one feature) and Multiple Linear Regression (with multiple features) were covered.
