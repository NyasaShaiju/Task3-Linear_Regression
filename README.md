# Task3-Linear_Regression
Objective: The goal of this task was to implement and understand simple linear regression using the Titanic dataset.

What I Did: 
1.Imported and preprocessed the dataset (selected Age and Fare columns, removed missing values).
2.Split the data into training and testing sets.
3.Built a Linear Regression model using sklearn.
4.Trained the model to predict Fare based on Age.
5.Evaluated the model using metrics like MAE, MSE, and RÂ² Score.
6.Plotted the regression line over the test data points.
7.Interpreted the slope and intercept of the regression line.

Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
